# BCS homework #1

Your task is to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible

## What was done

The following things were corected:

* Fixed internal hyperlinks.
* Fixed non working css classes.
* Added "alt" to each image. 
* Corrected head section.
* Added reset.css.
* Changed imaged to be on CDN... should be quicker now but it is not?!
  
* Changed the code so the website looks better... here I have a felling I went a bit too far with the redesign.

>In addition to that, GitHub repo was created and website was added as well.
